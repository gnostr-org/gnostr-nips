## Events

### Poll Event

The poll event is defined as a `kind:1068` event.

- **content** key holds the label for the poll.

Major tags in the poll event are:


- **option**: The option tags contain an OptionId(any alphanumeric) field, followed by an option label field.
- **relay**: One or multiple tags that the poll is expecting respondents to respond on.
- **polltype**: can be "singlechoice", "multiplechoice", or "rankedchoice". Polls that do not have a polltype should be considered a "singlechoice" poll.

Example Response Event

  "id": "60a005e32e9596c3f544a841a9bc4e46d3020ca3650d6a739c95c1568e33f6d8",

    ["response", "m3agjsdq1"]
  ]
}
```

### Poll Types

Poll Types can be configured in the settings object of the poll, the setting dictates how multiple response tags are handled in the `kind:30068` event.

- **PollType: singlechoice**: The first response tag is to be considered the actual response.
- **PollType: multiplechoice**: The first response tag pointing to each id is considered the actual response, without considering the order of the response tags.
- **PollType: rankedchoice**: The first response tag pointing to each id is the considered the actual response, while also taking into account the order of the response tags.

### Counting Results

Results can be queried by fetching `kind:30068` events from the relays specified in the poll.
The results displayed should only be 1 vote event per pubkey.
In case of multiple events for a pubkey, the event with the largest timestamp should be considered.

### Curation

The clients may configure fetching results by specific people. This can be achieved by creating `kind:30000` follow sets, and fetching results only from the follow set.
Clients can also employ other curation algorithms, like Proof Of Work and Web of Trust scores for result curations.
