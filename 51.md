Lists
-----

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines lists of things that users can create. Lists can contain references to anything, and these references can be **public** or **private**.

Public items in a list are specified in the event `tags` array, while private items are specified in a JSON array that mimics the structure of the event `tags` array, but stringified and encrypted using the same scheme from [NIP-04](04.md) (the shared key is computed using the author's public and private key) and stored in the `.content`.

## Generic lists

The kinds `30000` and `30001` have been reserved for generic lists. These must be accompanied by a `d` tag identifying the list, but these are generally client-specific, except in the standard cases specified below.
