NIP-03

OpenTimestamps Attestations for Events

draft optional

This NIP defines an event with kind:1040 that can contain an
OpenTimestamps proof for any other event:

    {
      "kind": 1040
      "tags": [
        ["e", <event-id>, <relay-url>],
        ["alt", "opentimestamps attestation"]
      ],
      "content": <base64-encoded OTS file data>
    }

-   The OpenTimestamps proof MUST prove the referenced e event id as its
    digest.
-   The content MUST be the full content of an .ots file containing at
    least one Bitcoin attestation. This file SHOULD contain a single
    Bitcoin attestation (as not more than one valid attestation is
    necessary and less bytes is better than more) and no reference to
    &ldquo;pending&rdquo; attestations since they are useless in this
    context.

Example OpenTimestamps proof verification flow

Using nak, jq and ots:

    ~> nak req -i e71c6ea722987debdb60f81f9ea4f604b5ac0664120dd64fb9d23abc4ec7c323 wss://nostr-pub.wellorder.net | jq -r .content | ots verify
    > using an esplora server at https://blockstream.info/api
    - sequence ending on block 810391 is valid
    timestamp validated at block [810391]
