<h1>NIP-18</h1>
<h2>Reposts</h2>
<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>A repost is a <code>kind 6</code> event that is used to signal to followers
that a <code>kind 1</code> text note is worth reading.</p>
<p>The <code>content</code> of a repost event is <em>the stringified JSON of the reposted note</em>. It MAY also be empty, but that is not recommended.
Reposts of <a href="70.md">NIP-70</a>-protected events SHOULD always have an empty <code>content</code>.</p>
<p>The repost event MUST include an <code>e</code> tag with the <code>id</code> of the note that is
being reposted. That tag MUST include a relay URL as its third entry
to indicate where it can be fetched.</p>
<p>The repost SHOULD include a <code>p</code> tag with the <code>pubkey</code> of the event being
reposted.</p>
<h2>Quote Reposts</h2>
<p>Quote reposts are <code>kind 1</code> events with an embedded <code>q</code> tag of the note being
quote reposted. The <code>q</code> tag ensures quote reposts are not pulled and included
as replies in threads. It also allows you to easily pull and count all of the
quotes for a post.</p>
<p><code>q</code> tags should follow the same conventions as NIP 10 <code>e</code> tags, with the exception
of the <code>mark</code> argument.</p>
<p><code>["q", &lt;event-id&gt;, &lt;relay-url&gt;, &lt;pubkey&gt;]</code></p>
<p>Quote reposts MUST include the <a href="21.md">NIP-21</a> <code>nevent</code>, <code>note</code>, or <code>naddr</code> of the
event in the content.</p>
<h2>Generic Reposts</h2>
<p>Since <code>kind 6</code> reposts are reserved for <code>kind 1</code> contents, we use <code>kind 16</code>
as a "generic repost", that can include any kind of event inside other than
<code>kind 1</code>.</p>
<p><code>kind 16</code> reposts SHOULD contain a <code>k</code> tag with the stringified kind number
of the reposted event as its value.</p>
