<h1>NIP-78</h1>
<h2>Arbitrary custom app data</h2>
<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>The goal of this NIP is to enable <a href="https://remotestorage.io/">remoteStorage</a>-like capabilities for custom applications that do not care about interoperability.</p>
<p>Even though interoperability is great, some apps do not want or do not need interoperability, and it wouldn't make sense for them. Yet Nostr can still serve as a generalized data storage for these apps in a "bring your own database" way, for example: a user would open an app and somehow input their preferred relay for storage, which would then enable these apps to store application-specific data there.</p>
<h2>Nostr event</h2>
<p>This NIP specifies the use of event kind <code>30078</code> (an <em>addressable</em> event) with a <code>d</code> tag containing some reference to the app name and context -- or any other arbitrary string. <code>content</code> and other <code>tags</code> can be anything or in any format.</p>
<h2>Some use cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>User personal settings on Nostr clients (and other apps unrelated to Nostr)</li>
<li>A way for client developers to propagate dynamic parameters to users without these having to update</li>
<li>Personal private data generated by apps that have nothing to do with Nostr, but allow users to use Nostr relays as their personal database</li>
</ul>
