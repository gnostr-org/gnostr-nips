<h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>
<p><code>optional</code></p>
<p>A report is a <code>kind 1984</code> event that signals to users and
relays that some referenced content is objectionable. The definition of
objectionable is obviously subjective and all agents on the network
(users, apps, relays, etc.) may consume and take action on them as they
see fit.</p>
<p>The <code>content</code> MAY contain additional information submitted
by the entity reporting the content.</p>
<h2 id="tags">Tags</h2>
<p>The report event MUST include a <code>p</code> tag referencing the
pubkey of the user you are reporting.</p>
<p>If reporting a note, an <code>e</code> tag MUST also be included
referencing the note id.</p>
<p>A <code>report type</code> string MUST be included as the 3rd entry
to the <code>e</code> or <code>p</code> tag being reported, which
consists of the following report types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nudity</code> - depictions of nudity, porn, etc.</li>
<li><code>malware</code> - virus, trojan horse, worm, robot, spyware,
adware, back door, ransomware, rootkit, kidnapper, etc.</li>
<li><code>profanity</code> - profanity, hateful speech, etc.</li>
<li><code>illegal</code> - something which may be illegal in some
jurisdiction</li>
<li><code>spam</code> - spam</li>
<li><code>impersonation</code> - someone pretending to be someone
else</li>
<li><code>other</code> - for reports that don&#x2019;t fit in the above
categories</li>
</ul>
<p>Some report tags only make sense for profile reports, such as
<code>impersonation</code></p>
<p><code>l</code> and <code>L</code> tags MAY be also be used as defined
in <a href="32.md.html">NIP-32</a> to support further qualification and
querying.</p>

<h2 id="client-behavior">Client behavior</h2>
<p>Clients can use reports from friends to make moderation decisions if
they choose to. For instance, if 3+ of your friends report a profile for
<code>nudity</code>, clients can have an option to automatically blur
photos from said account.</p>
<h2 id="relay-behavior">Relay behavior</h2>
<p>It is not recommended that relays perform automatic moderation using
reports, as they can be easily gamed. Admins could use reports from
trusted moderators to takedown illegal or explicit content if the relay
does not allow such things.</p>
