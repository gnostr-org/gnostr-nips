<p><code>final</code> <code>unrecommended</code>
<code>optional</code></p>
<p>This document standardizes the treatment given by clients of inline
mentions of other events and pubkeys inside the content of
<code>text_note</code>s.</p>
<p>Clients that want to allow tagged mentions they MUST show an
autocomplete component or something analogous to that whenever the user
starts typing a special key (for example, &#x201C;@&#x201D;) or presses some button to
include a mention etc &#x2013; or these clients can come up with other ways to
unambiguously differentiate between mentions and normal text.</p>
<p>Once a mention is identified, for example, the pubkey
<code>27866e9d854c78ae625b867eefdfa9580434bc3e675be08d2acb526610d96fbe</code>,
the client MUST add that pubkey to the <code>.tags</code> with the tag
<code>p</code>, then replace its textual reference (inside
<code>.content</code>) with the notation <code>#[index]</code> in which
&#x201C;index&#x201D; is equal to the 0-based index of the related tag in the tags
array.</p>
<p>The same process applies for mentioning event IDs.</p>
<p>A client that receives a <code>text_note</code> event with such
<code>#[index]</code> mentions in its <code>.content</code> CAN do a
search-and-replace using the actual contents from the <code>.tags</code>
array with the actual pubkey or event ID that is mentioned, doing any
desired context augmentation (for example, linking to the pubkey or
showing a preview of the mentioned event contents) it wants in the
process.</p>
<p>Where <code>#[index]</code> has an <code>index</code> that is outside
the range of the tags array or points to a tag that is not an
<code>e</code> or <code>p</code> tag or a tag otherwise declared to
support this notation, the client MUST NOT perform such replacement or
augmentation, but instead display it as normal text.</p>
