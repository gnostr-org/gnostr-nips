<h2 id="search-capability">Search Capability</h2>
<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Many Nostr use cases require some form of general search feature, in
addition to structured queries by tags or ids. Specifics of the search
algorithms will differ between event kinds, this NIP only describes a
general extensible framework for performing such queries.</p>
<h2 id="search-filter-field"><code>search</code> filter field</h2>
<p>A new <code>search</code> field is introduced for <code>REQ</code>
messages from clients:</p>
<pre class="jsonc"><code>{
  // other fields on filter object...
  &quot;search&quot;: &lt;string&gt;
}</code></pre>
<p><code>search</code> field is a string describing a query in a
human-readable form, i.e.&#xA0;&#x201C;best nostr apps&#x201D;. Relays SHOULD interpret the
query to the best of their ability and return events that match it.
Relays SHOULD perform matching against <code>content</code> event field,
and MAY perform matching against other fields if that makes sense in the
context of a specific kind.</p>
<p>Results SHOULD be returned in descending order by quality of search
result (as defined by the implementation), not by the usual
<code>.created_at</code>. The <code>limit</code> filter SHOULD be
applied after sorting by matching score. A query string may contain
<code>key:value</code> pairs (two words separated by colon), these are
extensions, relays SHOULD ignore extensions they don&#x2019;t support.</p>
<p>Clients may specify several search filters,
i.e.&#xA0;<code>["REQ", "", { "search": "orange" }, { "kinds": [1, 2], "search": "purple" }]</code>.
Clients may include <code>kinds</code>, <code>ids</code> and other
filter field to restrict the search results to particular event
kinds.</p>
<p>Clients SHOULD use the supported_nips field to learn if a relay
supports <code>search</code> filter. Clients MAY send
<code>search</code> filter queries to any relay, if they are prepared to
filter out extraneous responses from relays that do not support this
NIP.</p>
<p>Clients SHOULD query several relays supporting this NIP to compensate
for potentially different implementation details between relays.</p>
<p>Clients MAY verify that events returned by a relay match the
specified query in a way that suits the client&#x2019;s use case, and MAY stop
querying relays that have low precision.</p>
<p>Relays SHOULD exclude spam from search results by default if they
support some form of spam filtering.</p>
<h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2>
<p>Relay MAY support these extensions: - <code>include:spam</code> -
turn off spam filtering, if it was enabled by default -
<code>domain:&lt;domain&gt;</code> - include only events from users
whose valid nip05 domain matches the domain -
<code>language:&lt;two letter ISO 639-1 language code&gt;</code> -
include only events of a specified language -
<code>sentiment:&lt;negative/neutral/positive&gt;</code> - include only
events of a specific sentiment - <code>nsfw:&lt;true/false&gt;</code> -
include or exclude nsfw events (default: true)</p>
