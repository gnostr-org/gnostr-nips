kinds</h2>
<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>When creating a new custom event kind that is part of a custom
protocol and isn&#x2019;t meant to be read as text (like <code>kind:1</code>),
clients should use an <code>alt</code> tag to write a short
human-readable plaintext summary of what that event is about.</p>
<p>The intent is that social clients, used to display only
<code>kind:1</code> notes, can still show something in case a custom
event pops up in their timelines. The content of the <code>alt</code>
tag should provide enough context for a user that doesn&#x2019;t know anything
about this event kind to understand what it is.</p>
<p>These clients that only know <code>kind:1</code> are not expected to
ask relays for events of different kinds, but users could still
reference these weird events on their notes, and without proper context
these could be nonsensical notes. Having the fallback text makes that
situation much better &#x2013; even if only for making the user aware that they
should try to view that custom event elsewhere.</p>
<p><code>kind:1</code>-centric clients can make interacting with these
event kinds more functional by supporting <a
