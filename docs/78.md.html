<h2 id="arbitrary-custom-app-data">Arbitrary custom app data</h2>
<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>The goal of this NIP is to enable <a
href="https://remotestorage.io/">remoteStorage</a>-like capabilities for
custom applications that do not care about interoperability.</p>
<p>Even though interoperability is great, some apps do not want or do
not need interoperability, and it wouldn&#x2019;t make sense for them. Yet
Nostr can still serve as a generalized data storage for these apps in a
&#x201C;bring your own database&#x201D; way, for example: a user would open an app and
somehow input their preferred relay for storage, which would then enable
these apps to store application-specific data there.</p>
<h2 id="nostr-event">Nostr event</h2>
<p>This NIP specifies the use of event kind <code>30078</code>
(parameterized replaceable event) with a <code>d</code> tag containing
some reference to the app name and context &#x2013; or any other arbitrary
string. <code>content</code> and other <code>tags</code> can be anything
or in any format.</p>
<h2 id="some-use-cases">Some use cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>User personal settings on Nostr clients (and other apps unrelated to
Nostr)</li>
<li>A way for client developers to propagate dynamic parameters to users
without these having to update</li>
<li>Personal private data generated by apps that have nothing to do with
Nostr, but allow users to use Nostr relays as their personal
database</li>
</ul>
