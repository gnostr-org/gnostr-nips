<h1>NIP-38</h1>
<h2>User Statuses</h2>
<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This NIP enables a way for users to share live statuses such as what music they are listening to, as well as what they are currently doing: work, play, out of office, etc.</p>
<h2>Live Statuses</h2>
<p>A special event with <code>kind:30315</code> "User Status" is defined as an <em>optionally expiring</em> <em>addressable event</em>, where the <code>d</code> tag represents the status type:</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "kind": 30315,
  "content": "Sign up for nostrasia!",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "general"],
    ["r", "https://nostr.world"]
  ],
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "kind": 30315,
  "content": "Intergalatic - Beastie Boys",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "music"],
    ["r", "spotify:search:Intergalatic%20-%20Beastie%20Boys"],
    ["expiration", "1692845589"]
  ],
}
</code></pre>
<p>Two common status types are defined: <code>general</code> and <code>music</code>. <code>general</code> represent general statuses: "Working", "Hiking", etc.</p>
<p><code>music</code> status events are for live streaming what you are currently listening to. The expiry of the <code>music</code> status should be when the track will stop playing.</p>
<p>Any other status types can be used but they are not defined by this NIP.</p>
<p>The status MAY include an <code>r</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>e</code> or <code>a</code> tag linking to a URL, profile, note, or addressable event.</p>
<p>The <code>content</code> MAY include emoji(s), or <a href="30.md">NIP-30</a> custom emoji(s). If the <code>content</code> is an empty string then the client should clear the status.</p>
<h1>Client behavior</h1>
