<h2>Handling Mentions</h2>
<p><code>final</code> <code>unrecommended</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>This document standardizes the treatment given by clients of inline mentions of other events and pubkeys inside the content of <code>text_note</code>s.</p>
<p>Clients that want to allow tagged mentions they MUST show an autocomplete component or something analogous to that whenever the user starts typing a special key (for example, "@") or presses some button to include a mention etc -- or these clients can come up with other ways to unambiguously differentiate between mentions and normal text.</p>
<p>Once a mention is identified, for example, the pubkey <code>27866e9d854c78ae625b867eefdfa9580434bc3e675be08d2acb526610d96fbe</code>, the client MUST add that pubkey to the <code>.tags</code> with the tag <code>p</code>, then replace its textual reference (inside <code>.content</code>) with the notation <code>#[index]</code> in which "index" is equal to the 0-based index of the related tag in the tags array.</p>
<p>The same process applies for mentioning event IDs.</p>
<p>A client that receives a <code>text_note</code> event with such <code>#[index]</code> mentions in its <code>.content</code> CAN do a search-and-replace using the actual contents from the <code>.tags</code> array with the actual pubkey or event ID that is mentioned, doing any desired context augmentation (for example, linking to the pubkey or showing a preview of the mentioned event contents) it wants in the process.</p>
<p>Where <code>#[index]</code> has an <code>index</code> that is outside the range of the tags array or points to a tag that is not an <code>e</code> or <code>p</code> tag or a tag otherwise declared to support this notation, the client MUST NOT perform such replacement or augmentation, but instead display it as normal text.</p>
