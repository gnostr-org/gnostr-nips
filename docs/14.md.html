<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>This NIP defines the use of the &#x201C;subject&#x201D; tag in text (kind: 1)
events. (implemented in more-speech)</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode json"><code class="sourceCode json"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">[</span><span class="st">&quot;subject&quot;</span><span class="er">:</span> <span class="er">&lt;string&gt;</span><span class="ot">]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Browsers often display threaded lists of messages. The contents of
the subject tag can be used in such lists, instead of the more ad hoc
approach of using the first few words of the message. This is very
similar to the way email browsers display lists of incoming emails by
subject rather than by contents.</p>
<p>When replying to a message with a subject, clients SHOULD replicate
the subject tag. Clients MAY adorn the subject to denote that it is a
reply. e.g.&#xA0;by prepending &#x201C;Re:&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Subjects should generally be shorter than 80 chars. Long subjects
will likely be trimmed by clients.</p>
