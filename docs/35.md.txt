NIP-35

Torrents

draft optional

This NIP defined a new kind 2003 which is a Torrent.

kind 2003 is a simple torrent index where there is enough information to
search for content and construct the magnet link. No torrent files exist
on nostr.

Tags

-   x: V1 BitTorrent Info Hash, as seen in the magnet link
    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:HASH
-   file: A file entry inside the torrent, including the full path ie.
    info/example.txt
-   tracker: (Optional) A tracker to use for this torrent

In order to make torrents searchable by general category, you SHOULD
include a few tags like movie, tv, HD, UHD etc.

Tag prefixes

Tag prefixes are used to label the content with references, ie.
["i", ".txtb:1234"]

-   tcat: A comma separated text category path, ie.
    ["i", "tcat:video,movie,4k"], this should also match the newznab
    category in a best effort approach.
-   newznab: The category ID from newznab
-   .txtb: The movie database id.
-   ttvdb: TV database id.
-   .txtb: IMDB id.
-   mal: MyAnimeList id.
-   anilist: AniList id.

A second level prefix should be included where the database supports
multiple media types. - .txtb:movie:693134 maps to
themoviedb.org/movie/693134 - ttvdb:movie:290272 maps to
thetvdb.com/movies/dune-part-two - mal:anime:9253 maps to
myanimelist.net/anime/9253 - mal:manga:17517 maps to
myanimelist.net/manga/17517

In some cases the url mapping isnt direct, mapping the url in general is
out of scope for this NIP, the section above is only a guide so that
implementers have enough information to succsesfully map the url if they
wish.

        ["t", "movie"],
        ["t", "4k"],
      ]
    }

Torrent Comments

A torrent comment is a kind 2004 event which is used to reply to a
torrent event.

This event works exactly like a kind 1 and should follow NIP-10 for
tagging.
