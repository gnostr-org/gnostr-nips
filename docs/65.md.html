<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>Defines a replaceable event using <code>kind:10002</code> to
advertise preferred relays for discovering a user&#x2019;s content and
receiving fresh content from others.</p>
<p>The event MUST include a list of <code>r</code> tags with relay URIs
and a <code>read</code> or <code>write</code> marker. Relays marked as
<code>read</code> / <code>write</code> are called READ / WRITE relays,
respectively. If the marker is omitted, the relay is used for both
purposes.</p>
<p>The <code>.content</code> is not used.</p>

<p>This NIP doesn&#x2019;t fully replace relay lists that are designed to
configure a client&#x2019;s usage of relays (such as <code>kind:3</code> style
relay lists). Clients MAY use other relay lists in situations where a
<code>kind:10002</code> relay list cannot be found.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-read-and-write-relays">When to Use Read and Write
Relays</h2>
<p>When seeking events <strong>from</strong> a user, Clients SHOULD use
the WRITE relays of the user&#x2019;s <code>kind:10002</code>.</p>
<p>When seeking events <strong>about</strong> a user, where the user was
tagged, Clients SHOULD use the READ relays of the user&#x2019;s
<code>kind:10002</code>.</p>
<p>When broadcasting an event, Clients SHOULD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadcast the event to the WRITE relays of the author</li>
<li>Broadcast the event to all READ relays of each tagged user</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The old model of using a fixed relay list per user centralizes in
large relay operators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most users submit their posts to the same highly popular relays,
aiming to achieve greater visibility among a broader audience</li>
<li>Many users are pulling events from a large number of relays in order
to get more data at the expense of duplication</li>
<li>Events are being copied between relays, oftentimes to many different
relays</li>
</ul>
<p>This NIP allows Clients to connect directly with the most up-to-date
relay set from each individual user, eliminating the need of
broadcasting events to popular relays.</p>
<h2 id="final-considerations">Final Considerations</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Clients SHOULD guide users to keep <code>kind:10002</code> lists
small (2-4 relays).</p></li>
<li><p>Clients SHOULD spread an author&#x2019;s <code>kind:10002</code> event
to as many relays as viable.</p></li>
<li><p><code>kind:10002</code> events should primarily be used to
advertise the user&#x2019;s preferred relays to others. A user&#x2019;s own client may
use other heuristics for selecting relays for fetching data.</p></li>
<li><p>DMs SHOULD only be broadcasted to the author&#x2019;s WRITE relays and
to the receiver&#x2019;s READ relays to keep maximum privacy.</p></li>
<li><p>If a relay signals support for this NIP in their <a
href="11.md.html">NIP-11</a> document that means they&#x2019;re willing to accept
kind 10002 events from a broad range of users, not only their paying
customers or whitelisted group.</p></li>
<li><p>Clients SHOULD deduplicate connections by normalizing relay URIs
according to <a
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-6">RFC
3986</a>.</p></li>
