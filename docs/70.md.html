<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>When the <code>"-"</code> tag is present, that means the event is
&#x201C;protected&#x201D;.</p>
<p>A protected event is an event that can only be published to relays by
its author. This is achieved by relays ensuring that the author is <a
href="42.md.html">authenticated</a> before publishing their own events or by
just rejecting events with <code>["-"]</code> outright.</p>
<p>The default behavior of a relay MUST be to reject any event that
contains <code>["-"]</code>.</p>
<p>Relays that want to accept such events MUST first require that the
client perform the <a href="42.md.html">NIP-42</a> <code>AUTH</code> flow and
then check if the authenticated client has the same pubkey as the event
being published and only accept the event in that case.</p>
<h2 id="the-tag">The tag</h2>
<p>The tag is a simple tag with a single item: <code>["-"]</code>. It
may be added to any event.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>There are multiple circumstances in which it would be beneficial to
prevent the unlimited spreading of an event through all relays
imaginable and restrict some to only a certain demographic or to a
semi-closed community relay. Even when the information is public it may
make sense to keep it compartimentalized across different relays.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s also possible to create closed access feeds with this when the
publisher has some relationship with the relay and trusts the relay to
not release their published events to anyone.</p>
<p>Even though it&#x2019;s ultimately impossible to restrict the spread of
information on the internet (for example, one of the members of the
closed group may want to take an event intended to be restricted and
republish it to other relays), most relays would be happy to not
facilitate the acts of these so-called &#x201C;pirates&#x201D;, in respect to the
original decision of the author and therefore gladly reject these
republish acts if given the means to.</p>
<p>This NIP gives these authors and relays the means to clearly signal
when a given event is not intended to be republished by third
parties.</p>
