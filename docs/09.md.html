<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>A special event with kind <code>5</code>, meaning &#x201C;deletion&#x201D; is
defined as having a list of one or more <code>e</code> tags, each
referencing an event the author is requesting to be deleted.</p>
<p>Each tag entry must contain an &#x201C;e&#x201D; event id and/or <code>a</code>
tags intended for deletion.</p>
<p>The event&#x2019;s <code>content</code> field MAY contain a text note
describing the reason for the deletion.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;kind&quot;: 5,
  &quot;pubkey&quot;: &lt;32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator&gt;,
  &quot;tags&quot;: [
    [&quot;e&quot;, &quot;dcd59..464a2&quot;],
    [&quot;e&quot;, &quot;968c5..ad7a4&quot;],
    [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;&lt;kind&gt;:&lt;pubkey&gt;:&lt;d-identifier&gt;&quot;]
  ],
  &quot;content&quot;: &quot;these posts were published by accident&quot;,
  ...other fields
}</code></pre>
<p>Relays SHOULD delete or stop publishing any referenced events that
have an identical <code>pubkey</code> as the deletion request. Clients
SHOULD hide or otherwise indicate a deletion status for referenced
events.</p>
<p>Relays SHOULD continue to publish/share the deletion events
indefinitely, as clients may already have the event that&#x2019;s intended to
be deleted. Additionally, clients SHOULD broadcast deletion events to
other relays which don&#x2019;t have it.</p>
<p>When an <code>a</code> tag is used, relays SHOULD delete all versions
of the replaceable event up to the <code>created_at</code> timestamp of
the deletion event.</p>
<h2 id="client-usage">Client Usage</h2>
<p>Clients MAY choose to fully hide any events that are referenced by
valid deletion events. This includes text notes, direct messages, or
other yet-to-be defined event kinds. Alternatively, they MAY show the
event along with an icon or other indication that the author has
&#x201C;disowned&#x201D; the event. The <code>content</code> field MAY also be used to
replace the deleted events&#x2019; own content, although a user interface
should clearly indicate that this is a deletion reason, not the original
content.</p>
<p>A client MUST validate that each event <code>pubkey</code> referenced
in the <code>e</code> tag of the deletion request is identical to the
deletion request <code>pubkey</code>, before hiding or deleting any
event. Relays can not, in general, perform this validation and should
not be treated as authoritative.</p>
<p>Clients display the deletion event itself in any way they choose,
e.g., not at all, or with a prominent notice.</p>
<h2 id="relay-usage">Relay Usage</h2>
<p>Relays MAY validate that a deletion event only references events that
have the same <code>pubkey</code> as the deletion itself, however this
is not required since relays may not have knowledge of all referenced
events.</p>
<h2 id="deleting-a-deletion">Deleting a Deletion</h2>
<p>Publishing a deletion event against a deletion has no effect. Clients
and relays are not obliged to support &#x201C;undelete&#x201D; functionality.</p>
