<h2 id="event-deletion-request">Event Deletion Request</h2>
<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>A special event with kind <code>5</code>, meaning &#x201C;deletion request&#x201D;
is defined as having a list of one or more <code>e</code> or
<code>a</code> tags, each referencing an event the author is requesting
to be deleted. Deletion requests SHOULD include a <code>k</code> tag for
the kind of each event being requested for deletion.</p>
<p>The event&#x2019;s <code>content</code> field MAY contain a text note
describing the reason for the deletion request.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="jsonc"><code>{
  &quot;kind&quot;: 5,
  &quot;pubkey&quot;: &lt;32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator&gt;,
  &quot;tags&quot;: [
    [&quot;e&quot;, &quot;dcd59..464a2&quot;],
    [&quot;e&quot;, &quot;968c5..ad7a4&quot;],
    [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;&lt;kind&gt;:&lt;pubkey&gt;:&lt;d-identifier&gt;&quot;],
    [&quot;k&quot;, &quot;1&quot;],
    [&quot;k&quot;, &quot;30023&quot;]
  ],
  &quot;content&quot;: &quot;these posts were published by accident&quot;,
  // other fields...
}</code></pre>
<p>Relays SHOULD delete or stop publishing any referenced events that
have an identical <code>pubkey</code> as the deletion request. Clients
SHOULD hide or otherwise indicate a deletion request status for
referenced events.</p>
<p>Relays SHOULD continue to publish/share the deletion request events
indefinitely, as clients may already have the event that&#x2019;s intended to
be deleted. Additionally, clients SHOULD broadcast deletion request
events to other relays which don&#x2019;t have it.</p>
<p>When an <code>a</code> tag is used, relays SHOULD delete all versions
of the replaceable event up to the <code>created_at</code> timestamp of
the deletion request event.</p>
<h2 id="client-usage">Client Usage</h2>
<p>Clients MAY choose to fully hide any events that are referenced by
valid deletion request events. This includes text notes, direct
messages, or other yet-to-be defined event kinds. Alternatively, they
MAY show the event along with an icon or other indication that the
author has &#x201C;disowned&#x201D; the event. The <code>content</code> field MAY also
be used to replace the deleted events&#x2019; own content, although a user
interface should clearly indicate that this is a deletion request
reason, not the original content.</p>
<p>A client MUST validate that each event <code>pubkey</code> referenced
in the <code>e</code> tag of the deletion request is identical to the
deletion request <code>pubkey</code>, before hiding or deleting any
event. Relays can not, in general, perform this validation and should
not be treated as authoritative.</p>
<p>Clients display the deletion request event itself in any way they
choose, e.g., not at all, or with a prominent notice.</p>
<p>Clients MAY choose to inform the user that their request for deletion
does not guarantee deletion because it is impossible to delete events
from all relays and clients.</p>
<h2 id="relay-usage">Relay Usage</h2>
<p>Relays MAY validate that a deletion request event only references
events that have the same <code>pubkey</code> as the deletion request
itself, however this is not required since relays may not have knowledge
of all referenced events.</p>
<h2 id="deletion-request-of-a-deletion-request">Deletion Request of a
Deletion Request</h2>
<p>Publishing a deletion request event against a deletion request has no
effect. Clients and relays are not obliged to support &#x201C;unrequest
deletion&#x201D; functionality.</p>
