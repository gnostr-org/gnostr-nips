<h1 id="nip-54">NIP-54</h1>
<h2 id="wiki">Wiki</h2>
<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>This NIP defines <code>kind:30818</code> (a <em>parameterized
replaceable event</em>) for long-form text content similar to <a
href="23.md.css.html">NIP-23</a>, but with one important difference: articles are
meant to be descriptions, or encyclopedia entries, of particular
subjects, and it’s expected that multiple people will write articles
about the exact same subjects, with either small variations or
completely independent content.</p>
<p>Articles are identified by lowercase, normalized ascii <code>d</code>
tags.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<pre class="jsonc"><code>{
  &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A wiki is a hypertext publication collaboratively edited and managed by its own audience.&quot;,
  &quot;tags&quot;: [
    [&quot;d&quot;, &quot;wiki&quot;],
    [&quot;title&quot;, &quot;Wiki&quot;],
  ]
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="d-tag-normalization-rules"><code>d</code> tag normalization
rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>Any non-letter character MUST be converted to a <code>-</code>.</li>
<li>All letters MUST be converted to lowercase.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="content-rules">Content rules</h3>
<p>The content should be Markdown, following the same rules as of <a
href="23.md.css.html">NIP-23</a>, although it takes some extra (optional)
metadata tags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>title</code>: for when the display title should be different
from the <code>d</code> tag.</li>
<li><code>summary</code>: for display in lists.</li>
<li><code>a</code> and <code>e</code>: for referencing the original
event a wiki article was forked from.</li>
</ul>
<p>One extra functionality is added: <strong>wikilinks</strong>. Unlike
normal Markdown links <code>[]()</code> that link to webpages, wikilinks
<code>[[]]</code> link to other articles in the wiki. In this case, the
wiki is the entirety of Nostr. Clicking on a wikilink should cause the
client to ask relays for events with <code>d</code> tags equal to the
target of that wikilink.</p>
<p>Wikilinks can take these two forms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>[[Target Page]]</code> – in this case it will link to the page
<code>target-page</code> (according to <code>d</code> tag normalization
rules above) and be displayed as <code>Target Page</code>;</li>
<li><code>[[target page|see this]]</code> – in this case it will link to
the page <code>target-page</code>, but will be displayed as
<code>see this</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="merge-requests">Merge Requests</h3>
<p>Event <code>kind:818</code> represents a request to merge from a
forked article into the source. It is directed to a pubkey and
references the original article and the modified event.</p>
<p>[INSERT EVENT EXAMPLE]</p>
<h3 id="redirects">Redirects</h3>
<p>Event <code>kind:30819</code> is also defined to stand for “wiki
redirects”, i.e. if one thinks <code>Shell structure</code> should
redirect to <code>Thin-shell structure</code> they can issue one of
these events instead of replicating the content. These events can be
used for automatically redirecting between articles on a client, but
also for generating crowdsourced “disambiguation” pages (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Disambiguation">common in
Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>[INSERT EVENT EXAMPLE]</p>
<h2 id="how-to-decide-what-article-to-display">How to decide what
article to display</h2>
<p>As there could be many articles for each given name, some kind of
prioritization must be done by clients. Criteria for this should vary
between users and clients, but some means that can be used are described
below:</p>
<h3 id="reactions">Reactions</h3>
<p><a href="25.md.css.html">NIP-25</a> reactions are very simple and can be used
to create a simple web-of-trust between wiki article writers and their
content. While just counting a raw number of “likes” is unproductive,
reacting to any wiki article event with a <code>+</code> can be
interpreted as a recommendation for that article specifically and a
partial recommendation of the author of that article. When 2 or 3-level
deep recommendations are followed, suddenly a big part of all the
articles may have some form of tagging.</p>
<h3 id="relays">Relays</h3>
<p><a href="51.md.css.html">NIP-51</a> lists of relays can be created with the
kind 10102 and then used by wiki clients in order to determine where to
query articles first and to rank these differently in relation to other
events fetched from other relays.</p>
<h3 id="contact-lists">Contact lists</h3>
<p><a href="02.md.css.html">NIP-02</a> contact lists can form the basis of a
recommendation system that is then expanded with relay lists and
reaction lists through nested queries. These lists form a good starting
point only because they are so widespread.</p>
<h3 id="wiki-related-contact-lists">Wiki-related contact lists</h3>
<p><a href="51.md.css.html">NIP-51</a> lists can also be used to create a list of
users that are trusted only in the context of wiki authorship or wiki
curationship.</p>
<h2 id="forks">Forks</h2>
<p>Wiki-events can tag other wiki-events with a <code>fork</code> marker
to specify that this event came from a different version. Both
<code>a</code> and <code>e</code> tags SHOULD be used and have the
<code>fork</code> marker applied, to identify the exact version it was
forked from.</p>
<h2 id="deference">Deference</h2>
<p>Wiki-events can tag other wiki-events with a <code>defer</code>
marker to indicate that it considers someone else’s entry as a “better”
version of itself. If using a <code>defer</code> marker both
<code>a</code> and <code>e</code> tags SHOULD be used.</p>
<p>This is a stronger signal of trust than a <code>+</code>
reaction.</p>
<p>This marker is useful when a user edits someone else’s entry; if the
original author includes the editor’s changes and the editor doesn’t
want to keep/maintain an independent version, the <code>link</code> tag
could effectively be a considered a “deletion” of the editor’s version
and putting that pubkey’s WoT weight behind the original author’s
version.</p>
<h2 id="why-markdown">Why Markdown?</h2>
<p>If the idea is to make a wiki then the most obvious text format to
use is probably the mediawiki/wikitext format used by Wikipedia since
it’s widely deployed in all mediawiki installations and used for decades
with great success. However, it turns out that format is very bloated
and convoluted, has way too many features and probably because of that
it doesn’t have many alternative implementations out there, and the ones
that exist are not complete and don’t look very trustworthy. Also it is
very much a centralized format that can probably be changed at the whims
of the Wikipedia owners.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Markdown has proven to work well for small scale
wikis and one of the biggest wikis in the planet (which is not very
often thought of as a wiki), <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> and its child sites,
and also one of the biggest “personal wiki” software, <a
href="https://obsidian.md.css.html/">Obsidian</a>. Markdown can probably deliver
95% of the functionality of wikitext. When augmented with tables,
diagram generators and MathJax (which are common extensions that exist
in the wild and can be included in this NIP) that rate probably goes to
99%, and its simplicity is a huge benefit that can’t be overlooked.
Wikitext format can also be transpíled into Markdown using Pandoc. Given
all that, I think it’s a reasonable suspicion that mediawiki is not
inherently better than Markdown, the success of Wikipedia probably
cannot be predicated on the syntax language choice.</p>
<h1 id="appendix-1-merge-requests">Appendix 1: Merge requests</h1>
<p>Users can request other users to get their entries merged into
someone else’s entry by creating a <code>kind:818</code> event.</p>
<pre class="jsonc"><code>{
  &quot;content&quot;: &quot;I added information about how to make hot ice-creams&quot;,
  &quot;kind&quot;: 818,
  &quot;tags&quot;: [
    [ &quot;a&quot;, &quot;30818:&lt;destination-pubkey&gt;:hot-ice-creams&quot;, &quot;&lt;relay-url&gt;&quot; ],
    [ &quot;e&quot;, &quot;&lt;version-against-which-the-modification-was-made&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;relay-url&gt;&#39; ],
    [ &quot;p&quot;, &quot;&lt;destination-pubkey&gt;&quot; ],
    [ &quot;e&quot;, &quot;&lt;version-to-be-merged&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;relay-url&gt;&quot;, &quot;source&quot; ]
  ]
}</code></pre>
<p><code>.content</code>: an optional explanation detailing why this
merge is being requested. <code>a</code> tag: tag of the article which
should be modified (i.e. the target of this merge request).
<code>e</code> tag: optional version of the article in which this
modifications is based <code>e</code> tag with <code>source</code>
marker: the ID of the event that should be merged. This event id MUST be
of a <code>kind:30818</code> as defined in this NIP.</p>
<p>The destination-pubkey (the pubkey being requested to merge something
into their article can create [[NIP-25]] reactions that tag the
<code>kind:818</code> event with <code>+</code> or <code>-</code></p>
</body>
