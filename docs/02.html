<h2>Follow List</h2>
<p><code>final</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>A special event with kind <code>3</code>, meaning "follow list" is defined as having a list of <code>p</code> tags, one for each of the followed/known profiles one is following.</p>
<p>Each tag entry should contain the key for the profile, a relay URL where events from that key can be found (can be set to an empty string if not needed), and a local name (or "petname") for that profile (can also be set to an empty string or not provided), i.e., <code>["p", &lt;32-bytes hex key&gt;, &lt;main relay URL&gt;, &lt;petname&gt;]</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>.content</code> is not used.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsonc">{
  "kind": 3,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "91cf9..4e5ca", "wss://alicerelay.com/", "alice"],
    ["p", "14aeb..8dad4", "wss://bobrelay.com/nostr", "bob"],
    ["p", "612ae..e610f", "ws://carolrelay.com/ws", "carol"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  // other fields...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Every new following list that gets published overwrites the past ones, so it should contain all entries. Relays and clients SHOULD delete past following lists as soon as they receive a new one.</p>
<p>Whenever new follows are added to an existing list, clients SHOULD append them to the end of the list, so they are stored in chronological order.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<h3>Follow list backup</h3>
<p>If one believes a relay will store their events for sufficient time, they can use this kind-3 event to backup their following list and recover on a different device.</p>
<h3>Profile discovery and context augmentation</h3>
<p>A client may rely on the kind-3 event to display a list of followed people by profiles one is browsing; make lists of suggestions on who to follow based on the follow lists of other people one might be following or browsing; or show the data in other contexts.</p>
<h3>Relay sharing</h3>
<p>A client may publish a follow list with good relays for each of their follows so other clients may use these to update their internal relay lists if needed, increasing censorship-resistance.</p>
<h3>Petname scheme</h3>
<p>The data from these follow lists can be used by clients to construct local <a href="http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/petnames/IntroPetNames.html">"petname"</a> tables derived from other people's follow lists. This alleviates the need for global human-readable names. For example:</p>
<p>A user has an internal follow list that says</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">[
  ["p", "21df6d143fb96c2ec9d63726bf9edc71", "", "erin"]
]
</code></pre>
<p>And receives two follow lists, one from <code>21df6d143fb96c2ec9d63726bf9edc71</code> that says</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">[
  ["p", "a8bb3d884d5d90b413d9891fe4c4e46d", "", "david"]
]
</code></pre>
<p>and another from <code>a8bb3d884d5d90b413d9891fe4c4e46d</code> that says</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">[
  ["p", "f57f54057d2a7af0efecc8b0b66f5708", "", "frank"]
]
</code></pre>
<p>When the user sees <code>21df6d143fb96c2ec9d63726bf9edc71</code> the client can show <em>erin</em> instead;
When the user sees <code>a8bb3d884d5d90b413d9891fe4c4e46d</code> the client can show <em>david.erin</em> instead;
When the user sees <code>f57f54057d2a7af0efecc8b0b66f5708</code> the client can show <em>frank.david.erin</em> instead.</p>
