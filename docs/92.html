<h1>NIP-92</h1>
<h2>Media Attachments</h2>
<p>Media attachments (images, videos, and other files) may be added to events by including a URL in the event content, along with a matching <code>imeta</code> tag.</p>
<p><code>imeta</code> ("inline metadata") tags MAY add information about media URLs in the event's content. Each <code>imeta</code> tag SHOULD match a URL in the event content. Clients MAY replace imeta URLs with rich previews.</p>
<p>The <code>imeta</code> tag is variadic, and each entry is a space-delimited key/value pair.
Each <code>imeta</code> tag MUST have a <code>url</code>, and at least one other field. <code>imeta</code> MAY include
any field specified by <a href="./94.md">NIP 94</a>. There SHOULD be only one <code>imeta</code> tag per URL.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "content": "More image metadata tests donâ€™t mind me https://nostr.build/i/my-image.jpg",
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    [
      "imeta",
      "url https://nostr.build/i/my-image.jpg",
      "m image/jpeg",
      "blurhash eVF$^OI:${M{o#*0-nNFxakD-?xVM}WEWB%iNKxvR-oetmo#R-aen$",
      "dim 3024x4032",
      "alt A scenic photo overlooking the coast of Costa Rica",
      "x &lt;sha256 hash as specified in NIP 94&gt;",
      "fallback https://nostrcheck.me/alt1.jpg",
      "fallback https://void.cat/alt1.jpg"
    ]
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Recommended client behavior</h2>
<p>When uploading files during a new post, clients MAY include this metadata
after the file is uploaded and included in the post.</p>
<p>When pasting URLs during post composition, the client MAY download the file
and add this metadata before the post is sent.</p>
<p>The client MAY ignore <code>imeta</code> tags that do not match the URL in the event content.</p>
