<h2>Relay List Metadata</h2>
<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>Defines a replaceable event using <code>kind:10002</code> to advertise relays where the user generally <strong>writes</strong> to and relays where the user generally <strong>reads</strong> mentions.</p>
<p>The event MUST include a list of <code>r</code> tags with relay URLs as value and an optional <code>read</code> or <code>write</code> marker. If the marker is omitted, the relay is both <strong>read</strong> and <strong>write</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsonc">{
  "kind": 10002,
  "tags": [
    ["r", "wss://alicerelay.example.com"],
    ["r", "wss://brando-relay.com"],
    ["r", "wss://expensive-relay.example2.com", "write"],

<p>When downloading events <strong>from</strong> a user, clients SHOULD use the <strong>write</strong> relays of that user.</p>
<p>When downloading events <strong>about</strong> a user, where the user was tagged (mentioned), clients SHOULD use the user's <strong>read</strong> relays.</p>
<p>When publishing an event, clients SHOULD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send the event to the <strong>write</strong> relays of the author</li>
<li>Send the event to all <strong>read</strong> relays of each tagged user</li>
</ul>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Clients SHOULD guide users to keep <code>kind:10002</code> lists small (2-4 relays of each category).</p>
<h3>Discoverability</h3>
<p>Clients SHOULD spread an author's <code>kind:10002</code> event to as many relays as viable, paying attention to relays that, at any moment, serve naturally as well-known public indexers for these relay lists (where most other clients and users are connecting to in order to publish and fetch those).</p>
