<h1>NIP-65</h1>
<h2>Relay List Metadata</h2>
<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>Defines a replaceable event using <code>kind:10002</code> to advertise preferred relays for discovering a user's content and receiving fresh content from others.</p>
<p>The event MUST include a list of <code>r</code> tags with relay URIs and a <code>read</code> or <code>write</code> marker. Relays marked as <code>read</code> / <code>write</code> are called READ / WRITE relays, respectively. If the marker is omitted, the relay is used for both purposes.</p>
<p>The <code>.content</code> is not used.</p>

<p>This NIP doesn't fully replace relay lists that are designed to configure a client's usage of relays (such as <code>kind:3</code> style relay lists). Clients MAY use other relay lists in situations where a <code>kind:10002</code> relay list cannot be found.</p>
<h2>When to Use Read and Write Relays</h2>
<p>When seeking events <strong>from</strong> a user, Clients SHOULD use the WRITE relays of the user's <code>kind:10002</code>.</p>
<p>When seeking events <strong>about</strong> a user, where the user was tagged, Clients SHOULD use the READ relays of the user's <code>kind:10002</code>.</p>
<p>When broadcasting an event, Clients SHOULD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadcast the event to the WRITE relays of the author</li>
<li>Broadcast the event to all READ relays of each tagged user</li>
</ul>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The old model of using a fixed relay list per user centralizes in large relay operators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most users submit their posts to the same highly popular relays, aiming to achieve greater visibility among a broader audience</li>
<li>Many users are pulling events from a large number of relays in order to get more data at the expense of duplication</li>
<li>Events are being copied between relays, oftentimes to many different relays</li>
</ul>
<p>This NIP allows Clients to connect directly with the most up-to-date relay set from each individual user, eliminating the need of broadcasting events to popular relays.</p>
<h2>Final Considerations</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clients SHOULD guide users to keep <code>kind:10002</code> lists small (2-4 relays).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clients SHOULD spread an author's <code>kind:10002</code> event to as many relays as viable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>kind:10002</code> events should primarily be used to advertise the user's preferred relays to others. A user's own client may use other heuristics for selecting relays for fetching data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DMs SHOULD only be broadcasted to the author's WRITE relays and to the receiver's READ relays to keep maximum privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a relay signals support for this NIP in their <a href="11.md">NIP-11</a> document that means they're willing to accept kind 10002 events from a broad range of users, not only their paying customers or whitelisted group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clients SHOULD deduplicate connections by normalizing relay URIs according to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-6">RFC 3986</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When publishing to a relay, clients SHOULD ensure the user's <code>kind 10002</code> is also available on that relay. Relays SHOULD accept and serve <code>kind 10002</code> notes for any pubkey whose notes they store. Relays MAY scrape the network for missing <code>kind 10002</code> events. The goal here is that for any note served from a relay the user can also request the author's relay selections as a way of bootstrapping further context discovery.</p>
