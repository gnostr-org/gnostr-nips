<h1>NIP-13</h1>
<h2>Proof of Work</h2>
<p><code>draft</code> <code>optional</code></p>
<p>This NIP defines a way to generate and interpret Proof of Work for nostr notes. Proof of Work (PoW) is a way to add a proof of computational work to a note. This is a bearer proof that all relays and clients can universally validate with a small amount of code. This proof can be used as a means of spam deterrence.</p>
<p><code>difficulty</code> is defined to be the number of leading zero bits in the <code>NIP-01</code> id. For example, an id of <code>000000000e9d97a1ab09fc381030b346cdd7a142ad57e6df0b46dc9bef6c7e2d</code> has a difficulty of <code>36</code> with <code>36</code> leading 0 bits.</p>
<p><code>002f...</code> is <code>0000 0000 0010 1111...</code> in binary, which has 10 leading zeroes. Do not forget to count leading zeroes for hex digits &lt;= <code>7</code>.</p>
<h2>Mining</h2>
<p>To generate PoW for a <code>NIP-01</code> note, a <code>nonce</code> tag is used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{"content": "It's just me mining my own business", "tags": [["nonce", "1", "21"]]}
</code></pre>
<p>When mining, the second entry to the nonce tag is updated, and then the id is recalculated (see <a href="./01.md">NIP-01</a>). If the id has the desired number of leading zero bits, the note has been mined. It is recommended to update the <code>created_at</code> as well during this process.</p>
<p>The third entry to the nonce tag <code>SHOULD</code> contain the target difficulty. This allows clients to protect against situations where bulk spammers targeting a lower difficulty get lucky and match a higher difficulty. For example, if you require 40 bits to reply to your thread and see a committed target of 30, you can safely reject it even if the note has 40 bits difficulty. Without a committed target difficulty you could not reject it. Committing to a target difficulty is something all honest miners should be ok with, and clients <code>MAY</code> reject a note matching a target difficulty if it is missing a difficulty commitment.</p>

<h2>Validating</h2>
<p>Here is some reference C code for calculating the difficulty (aka number of leading zero bits) in a nostr event id:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int zero_bits(unsigned char b)
{
        int n = 0;

        if (b == 0)
                return 8;

        while (b &gt;&gt;= 1)
                n++;

        return 7-n;
}

/* find the number of leading zero bits in a hash */
int count_leading_zero_bits(unsigned char *hash)
{
        int bits, total, i;
        for (i = 0, total = 0; i &lt; 32; i++) {
                bits = zero_bits(hash[i]);
                total += bits;
                if (bits != 8)
                        break;
        }
        return total;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is some JavaScript code for doing the same thing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// hex should be a hexadecimal string (with no 0x prefix)
function countLeadingZeroes(hex) {
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i &lt; hex.length; i++) {
    const nibble = parseInt(hex[i], 16);
    if (nibble === 0) {
      count += 4;
    } else {
      count += Math.clz32(nibble) - 28;
      break;
    }
  }

  return count;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Delegated Proof of Work</h2>
<p>Since the <code>NIP-01</code> note id does not commit to any signature, PoW can be outsourced to PoW providers, perhaps for a fee. This provides a way for clients to get their messages out to PoW-restricted relays without having to do any work themselves, which is useful for energy-constrained devices like mobile phones.</p>
