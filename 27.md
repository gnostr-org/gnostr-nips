Text Note References
--------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf` `author:scsibug` `author:arthurfranca`

This document standardizes the treatment given by clients of inline references of other events and profiles inside the content of `text notes` (currently kinds 1 and 30023).

Once a mention is identified by a client, for example, when an user pastes a NIP-19 nostr profile string inside the event content input field (or optionally by any other means the client may wish to support, such as selecting an user from a context menu or autocompleter), the client MUST replace it with the notation `nostr:nprofile1qqsw3dy8cpu...6x2argwghx6egsqstvg` as per NIP-21 before effectively creating the event. The client MAY add the corresponding pubkey to the `.tags` with the tag `p` if it wishes to notify mentioned user.

The same process applies for referencing event IDs (using `nostr:nevent1...`), except that the client SHOULD NOT add the event id to the `.tags` with the tag `e` so to not negatively impact thread loading.
Because `e` tags on `text notes` are usually considered ancestor events used to build a conversarion thread (as per NIP-10), it is advised to use inline references when mentioning events and NOT adding corresponding `e` tag to the `.tags` event key.

Other nostr identifiers should be referenced similarly using NIP-21 URLs inside event content (e.g. `nostr:naddr1...` for parameterized replaceable events).

Note that the usage of `nostr:npub1...` for profile mentions or `nostr:note1...` for event mentions is discouraged due to their lack of embedded relay recommendation.

A reader client that receives a `text_note` event with such `nostr:...` mentions in its `.content` CAN do any desired context augmentation (for example, linking to the profile or showing a preview of the mentioned event contents) it wants in the process. If turning such mentions into links, they could become internal links, NIP-21 links or direct links to web clients that will handle these references.
