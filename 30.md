Event Copy
----------

`draft` `optional` `author:jb55` `author:arthurfranca`

An event of `kind 9` is used to copy any event from another pubkey. A copy
allows its creator to keep content around even when the original gets deleted.

The `content` of a copy event MUST be the stringified JSON of the whole original event.

The copy event SHOULD include a `k` tag with the `kind` of the note that is
being copied. This enables subscribing to a subset of copies.

The copy event SHOULD include an `e` tag with the `id` of the note that is
being copied. This allows the original author to know a specific event has been copied.

The copy event SHOULD include a `p` tag with the `pubkey` of the event being
copied to notify original author.
