======

`git` stuff
-----------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines all the ways code collaboration using and adjacent to [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) can be done using Nostr.

## Repository announcements

Git repositories are hosted in Git-enabled servers, but their existence can be announced using Nostr events, as well as their willingness to receive patches, bug reports and comments in general.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 30617,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<repo-id>"],
    ["name", "<human-readable project name>"],
    ["description", "brief human-readable project description>"],
    ["head", "<sha1-hex>"], // the current repository commit head, as hex
    ["web", "<url for browsing>"], // a webpage url, if the git server being used provides such a thing
    ["clone", "<url for git-cloning>"], // a url to be given to `git clone` so anyone can clone it
    ["patches", "<relay-url>"], // this signals that patches are welcome and will be searched for in this relay
    ["issues", "<relay-url>"] // this signals that bug reports, questions, comments and so on are welcome
  ]
}
```

The tags `web`, `clone`, `patches` and `issues` can be specified multiple times. Except `d`, all tags are optional.

## Patches

Patches can be sent by anyone to any repository. Patches to a specific repository SHOULD be sent to the relays specified in that repository's announcement event's `"patches"` tag. Patch events SHOULD include an `a` tag pointing to that repository's announcement address.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 1617,
  "content": "<patch>", // contents of <git format-patch>
  "tags": [
    ["a", "30617/<base-repo-owner-pubkey>/<base-repo-id>"]
  ]
}
```

## Branch merge

To be defined.

## Issues

Issues are Markdown text that is just human-readable conversational threads related to the repository: bug reports, feature requests, questions or comments of any kind.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 1621,
  "content": "<markdown text>",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "30617/<base-repo-owner-pubkey>/<base-repo-id>"]
  ]
}
```

## Replies

Replies are also Markdown text. The difference is that they MUST refer to one root thread event. Their root doesn't have to be a `kind:1621` _issue_, but also a `kind:1617` patch event.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 1622,
  "content": "<markdown text>",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "30617/<base-repo-owner-pubkey>/<base-repo-id>"],
    ["e", "<root-event-id>"],
  ]
}
```
