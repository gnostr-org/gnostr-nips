`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf` `author:arthurfranca`

A repost is a `kind 6` note that is used to signal to followers
that another event is worth reading.

The `content` of a repost event is empty. Optionally, it MAY contain
a comment in the same format of a kind 1 note content.

The repost event MUST include an `e` tag with the `id` of the note that is
being reposted. That tag SHOULD include a relay URL as its third entry
to indicate where it can be fetched.
When reposting a long-form content use an `a` tag instead.

The repost SHOULD include a `p` tag with the `pubkey` of the event being
reposted.
