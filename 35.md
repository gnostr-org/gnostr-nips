Draft Events 
------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines kind `31234` as a private wrap for drafts of any other event kind. 

The draft event is JSON-stringified, [NIP44-encrypted](44.md) to the signer's public key and placed inside the `.content` of the event.

An additional `k` tag identifies the kind of the draft event. 

```js
{
  "kind": 31234,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<identifier>"],
    ["k", "<kind of the draft event>"],
    ["e", "<anchor event event id>", "<relay-url>"],
    ["a", "<anchor event address>", "<relay-url>"],
  ],
  "content": nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify(draft_event)),
  // other fields
}
```

A blanked `.content` means this draft has been deleted by a client but relays still have the event. 

Tags `e` and `a` identify one or more anchor events, such as parent events on replies.
